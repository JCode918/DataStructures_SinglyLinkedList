Hello my name is Willard Joseph. 
This is the first in the series of Data structures. I thought that this would be a good way to practice and also help those who are just starting out.
Disclaimer: I do not promise this code to be error free. So please use at your own peril. However, hopefully it will follow all standards expected.
All the best and happy coding.
