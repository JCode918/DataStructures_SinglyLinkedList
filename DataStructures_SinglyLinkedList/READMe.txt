Hello My Fellow Coders, I go by the online monkier of JCode918.

This is the first in the series of Data structures. 
I thought that this would be a good way to practice and also help those who are just starting out.
Disclaimer: I do not promise this code to be error free. So please use at your own peril.
However, hopefully it will follow all standards expected, and give a different point of view.

All the best and happy coding.
